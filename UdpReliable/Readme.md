In computer networking, the Reliable User Datagram Protocol (RUDP) is a transport layer protocol designed at Bell Labs for the Plan 9 operating system. It aims to provide a solution where UDP is too primitive because guaranteed-order packet delivery is desirable, but TCP adds too much complexity/overhead. In order for RUDP to gain higher quality of service, RUDP implements features that are similar to TCP with less overhead. In order to ensure quality, it extends UDP by means of adding the following features:

1.Acknowledgment of received packets 2.Windowing and flow control 3.Retransmission of lost packets 4.Over buffering (Faster than real-time streaming)
